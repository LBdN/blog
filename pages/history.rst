Despite all our efforts, a changing market and some last minute contract cancellations made impossible to continue 

We worked for 5 years on Urban PAD. We made mistakes and had a few successes.
The software is not perfect (which one is ?) but this was an honest and solid product. I am proud of what we build.

I want to thank personnally all who believed in us and our products. 
More specifically, I would like to thank the community of users who trusted us. 
I appreciated your trust and am really sad to see the story ends this way. 

Best regards,

P.S: I know some of you are worried about the license issue. I am inquiring now how to help you with that. The obstacles are legal not technical.
