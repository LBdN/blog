    <p>Despite all our efforts, a changing market and some last minute contract cancellations made impossible to continue.</p>
<p>We worked for 5 years on Urban PAD. We made mistakes and had a few successes.
The software is not perfect (which one is ?) but this was an honest and solid product. I am proud of what we build.</p>
<p>I want to thank personnally all who believed in us and our products.
More specifically, I would like to thank the community of users who trusted us.
I appreciated your trust and am really sad to see the story ends this way.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>P.S: I know some of you are worried about the license issue. I am inquiring now how to help you with that. The obstacles are legal not technical.</p>
