About me
########

I am a 3O-something guy who loves to build software products, to read, to cook and to draw.

I have done a lot of different stuff in my work, from working as a consultant for Andersen to be the tool lead developper for Atari. 
( my expertise lies in software publishing (internal or external) : from building the coding pipeline to selecting the marketing way and means. )

I also funded my own startup, which closed recently after 5 years (the post-mortem is here) and am now thinking about my next move.

You can look at my profiles here and here.
