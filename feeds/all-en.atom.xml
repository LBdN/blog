I have done a lot of different stuff in my work, from working as a consultant for Andersen to be the tool lead developper for Atari.
( my expertise lies in software publishing (internal or external) : from building the coding pipeline to selecting the marketing way and means. )
I also Funded my own startup, which closed recently after 5 years (the post-mortem is here) and am now thinking about my next move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at my profiles here and here.&lt;/p&gt;
